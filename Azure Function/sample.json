I've used this makeup for several years and I can't recommend it enough. You can customize the coverage you want by using more or less of it. Whether you apply 1 pass or 3-4 passes, you're skin always looks natural, flawless and glowing. Seriously, it's amazing! I alternate between the loose powder and the pressed powder, depending on the time of year. Each color comes in both options. The loose powder is supposedly better for oily skin, but my experience has been that both formulas work very fell for any skin type. The loose powder will always be slightly darker than that same color in the pressed powder. For example, my color is Radiant so in the summer when my face has more color I use the Radiant loose powder, and in the winter I use Radiant pressed powder. The Jane Iredale setting spray really is necessary to \"activate\" the makeup and get the flawless finish. It will also make it so that your makeup lasts practically all day. Sometimes I'll spray my face again midday to freshen it up, but I never have to reapply or touch up my makeup.

{"reviewerID": "A2EGD8K9W5AHTG", "asin": "B0002MPS7G", "reviewerName": "Em", "verified": true, "reviewText": "When I was reading reviews for the popular Glycolix 10% and 20% GA pads and trying to decide which concentration to buy, for some reason the 15% didn't immediately come up in the product listing and also had the fewest reviews. I ended up going with the 15%, reasoning that if this concentration was too strong I would use them less frequently or just wash my face 10 minutes after application until my skin could tolerate them. But as it happened, the 15% were just right for me and I've been using them every night for a few weeks and have started to see some improvements in my skin tone. I have dry skin and somewhat larger pores on my nose, but otherwise no acne or other real skin problems.\n\nHow I use them: every night after washing my face, I pat it dry and then wipe one Glycolix pad over the skin of my face and neck and upper chest. There is enough product in each wipe to cover that much area and then some. I avoid my eyelids and the area between my nose and upper lip (the skin there is just a bit too sensitive on my face) but I do my entire neck, top to bottom and ear to ear, and my chest to the same point you might see if wearing a v-neck t-shirt. I do not wash it off afterwards. I do sometimes wait 30 minutes or so and then add some moisturizer or coconut oil over the drier parts of my face. And then I go to bed, so it stays on as well as anything can overnight. In the morning I wash my face in the shower, then moisturize and also put on a strong sunscreen (I use&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Neutrogena-Ultra-Sheer-Liquid-Sunblock-SPF-70-1-4-Ounce/dp/B0038ZXYP2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Liquid Sunblock, SPF 70, 1.4 Ounce</a>).\n\nThe short term results have been really smooth skin, and this is most noticeable on my neck and chest, where I've never exfoliated or really done any skin maintenance. It tingles and itches going on those areas (still does, even after 3 weeks) and the skin has become very, very smooth - like baby-smooth. My face also became a bit softer and smoother, but since I've exfoliated it pretty regularly over the years, the difference wasn't as pronounced.\n\nThe 3 week results have been a very gradual smoothing of the freckles and other dark spots on my skin, a very slight fading. I can still see the pores on my nose, but my makeup has been going on smoother and the skin looks silkier and more glowing. It's about the same effect that having a professional facial gives me, only I have this effect every day now and not just the day or two after the facial. That's pretty cool, since I pay about $60 or more for a facial and a third that for these pads.\n\nI haven't had any irritation, though I have noticed some dry skin flaking on my cheeks and the sides of my nose - this is the \"peel\" part of the acid, not a true peel where large amounts of skin come off as they do when you have a sunburn or serious chemical peel at the dermatologist, but just small amounts of surface cells being shed. A good moisturizer helps.\n\nI think I'm going to use the 15% for another month, then buy the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Topix-Glycolix-Elite-Treatment-Pads-20-60-Pads/dp/B00080DNUG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Topix Glycolix Elite Treatment Pads 20% 60 Pads</a>&nbsp;for my face and continue using the 15% for my neck and chest.

It looked like the same stuff (same bottle, same shampoo color & consistency) but what made me suspicious was the difference in smell.\n\nThe primary scent of the shampoo from Amazon is tea tree oil (sort of similar to Pine-Sol).  The primary scent of the stuff from the salon is peppermint with a background tea tree oil scent (a much nicer smell overall).  Then I used the salon stuff to wash my hair.  Wow, what a difference.  The salon stuff had a better tingle, it created a much thicker lather, rinsed cleaner, and left my hair with more body. Over the next four days, I tested my theory by washing my hair with the Amazon-bought shampoo one day and the salon-bought shampoo the next day.\n\nRESULT: The salon shampoo was FAR superior and I am certain I have been had.  I give the counterfeit shampoo two stars because it wasn't bad, but the real Paul Mitchell shampoo is so much better and I paid for the good stuff.\n\nI love Amazon, but they need to get to the bottom of this.

If you are able to use the Mach-50 or whatever they call them these days more power to you.\n\nBack when I first started shaving I could've shaved with the same Mach-3 cartdridge for an entire school year...rust deposits and all. Sadly those days are gone and my beard would now give a cheese grater a run for its money.  With that said . . . canned shaving cream also seemed to make the whole shaving thing a royal pain in the patella as it was drying and irritating to my skin. Again . . . if you can get away with the canned stuff count yourself very fortunate. In my teens a can of shaving cream would last me 2 years. Go figure.\n\nTo each his own as far as his methods are concerned. Lets talk about this cream now.  It comes in a huge tube and does look like it's something out of my grandfather's era.  I consider the tube to be a generous supply for the price. It smells slightly medicinal but in a good clean way. I especially enjoy using this stuff during the hot summer months or while on vacation. The tingle and smell is therapeutic and not overwhelming. It does not smell like you slopped a jar of Vicks vaporub on your face. It's more pleasant, yet some people just aren't fans of Eucalyptus.\n\nThe cream provides a great lather when paired with a decent shave bowl and brush. A little goes a long way. Squeeze a bead the size of nickel or dime in the bowl depending on how much lather you like. Wet your brush with warm water. Mix the cream in the bowl. You may add a few more drops of water to get the consistency you desire. Remember that the lather is on your brush and not in your bowl. Apply lather, shave, and rinse.\n\nI usually apply the lather for a minimum of 2 passes. More often 3. When I have a date with the little lady I go the extra mile with a 4th pass. Back to front. Front to back. Top to bottom. Bottom to top. If you enjoy the smell of your cream apply a little behind your ears and rub it in.\n\nFollow up with a toner based bump preventer if you're prone to razor bumps and then after shave. Lastly apply a shaving lotion.\n\nIf you stick with a routine your skin will be clear, your face soft, and the woman happy. Using products like this make shaving a little more enjoyable.

We have to turn it on to Low, and then try switching to High multiple times to get it to turn on to High. This is frustrating when you are in a hurry to get ready for work.

I constantly get asked what I'm wearing and I've even had women tell me that they were going to \"kidnap me and take me home\" lol.. We paid a little less with our employee discount but would gladly pay the few extra dollars at the normal price. This also arrived very very fast! I ordered Saturday night, chose the free shipping option and received today (Monday) around lunch. I checked it on an authenticity checker online and it's definitely legit. If you've been wearing it for a while, then you already know that as soon as you take that huge bottle out and spray it though. Just buy it, you can't go wrong!

After much research I found out that it was caused by one of the ingredients called methylisothiazolinone (MCI or MI). It's a somewhat common ingredient used in many hair products , house cleaners , and some body care products. It really is a shame because I loved this product. The smell was great and lasted forever. I am returning it for that reason alone. I suggest applying it to a small test area first to see if you will have a reaction before continuing to use it. Don't let this deter you from purchasing it.

Sadly, even the upscale department stores in town no longer carry Joy.\n\nIts key scents are rose and jasmine - classic and never out of style.

Joy, on the other hand, is never clingy or overpowering on me. I love it so much that I purchased a Joy smell-alike massage oil from a business I see at a yearly festival I attend.\n\nA word of warning about the purchase of expensive perfumes from online, though. I see Amazon is both the seller and shipper here. That's good news. Amazon is not going to sell counterfeits. They're a powerhouse seller with a reputation to uphold. Beware purchases on eBay or no name sites or companies. Scammers go to a great deal of trouble to create look alike packaging for their fake scents. I also assumed that buying used older bottles would be a way to save money, but it turns out they'll even partially fill real, used bottles with the fake stuff. I got burned on the second bottle of Joy I bought at one of those sites, but next bottle I buy will be from Amazon!

My hair doesn't go quite to its usual straight, but it's nowhere near the original bouncy curls & waves I left the house with.

The Marcel handle took some getting used to, but with practice without it plugged in, got the hang of it (checked out a couple YouTube tutorials for assistance).\n\nIn comparison, when I use my HerStyler flat iron (purchased from one of the kiosks at the mall) to curl my hair, the curls last until I wash them out (even a couple days after) and without any hairspray product. Could be a difference in the metals used in both tools?\n\nAs an experiment I did every few strands on my head with this Marcel Curling Iron, and alternated with curling a few strands with my HerStyler flat iron (in the morning before work). By early evening (without any wild head movement, as I work in an office), I was able to distinguish which strands were curled with which tool.\n\nI'll keep this Marcel Curling Iron, stick to using it for nights out (since the curls seem to have a deadline on how long they'll last), but I definitely won't be getting rid of my HerStyler flat iron.

I started with hair that is naturally curly and took a lot of sectioned blowdrying and sectioned straightening just to get it looking decent.  After using this product I was able to let it mostly air dry (which in the past I could not do if I wanted to wear it straight) then blowdry and straighten in 10 minutes without having to section and yank my hair straight with a paddle brush the whole time.\n\nI did use this product on my own to save myself hundreds of dollars.  I did a test run the night before with a single strand to make sure that my hair wouldn't have a bad reaction. I did the best I could with following the directions that come with this product.  It does require you to do the application of the products quickly!  This is where an experienced stylist would come in handy - the process of sectioning your hair and applying the products is tough, but do-able.  You're supposed to take 10 minutes to apply the first product and I took closer to 15, but took that into account while I waited for it to process.\n\nAfter rinsing and blowdrying for the first time I was discouraged.  I have blonde highlights and they looked fried... like someone who's bleached their hair too many times.  I kept going with the process, hoping that by the end my hair would not look so unhealthy.  Thankfully, that ended up being the case.  My hair feels soft and although I can tell that my ends and highlights are a bit dryer than usual, it's minimal and not something anyone else would notice - a bit of shine serum helps.  I'm sure too that a salon would have gotten the hair near my hairline around my face straighter... I have small little curls around my face and some of them are still there. Since the directions say to apply 1/4 inch from the scalp, I didn't want to get too close to my hairline.\n\nThe end result is worth the 3 hours this took me.  It takes me a quarter of the time to style my hair, and looks ten times better than it used to.  FYI, you need additional tools to apply this product properly that aren't included.  I ended up purchasing and using: an application brush/gloves/cape (got all 3 from Sallys Beauty for less than $5), fine tooth comb and wide tooth comb, Ion Protector (you apply this to your hair before processing to protect it), Bio Ionic hydrating conditioner and hydrating shampoo, flat iron, blowdryer, paddle brush or round brush, hand held mirror (if applying yourself, to see the back of your head).", "summary": "strenuous process, but worth it", "unixReviewTime": 1311897600}

This brand is new to me.  I have the \"ProQuinoa complex\" shampoo with sage since it appears that multiple items have been listed on this page in the past.\n\nMy particular hair concerns were frizz and color protection.  I have naturally light colored hair that I dye black, and it can get kind of brassy looking in the summer.  And I exercise a lot, so I have to shampoo every day.  My hair tends to dry out because of this, which leads to frizz, since I live in Georgia and it is summertime.\n\nThis is a sulfate-free shampoo and I do find myself using a lot of it, which is the reason I have taken off one star.  I am going to run out of my bottle in a few weeks.  When I use a lot, I can actually get something that approaches a pretty good lather.  This has a somewhat coconutty scent (I really can't smell the sage at all) and no artificial dyes.  It rinses out of my hair without leaving residue (doesn't make the shower slippery, either, which some sulfate free shampoos can do) and I do feel that my hair is clean afterwards.\n\nWith regards to color protection, my hairdresser did a semi-permanent color rinse a few weeks back to try to get rid of some of the brassiness (in her professional opinion this would look best and I trust her judgment).  And, that is still working, despite washing my hair every day in between.  My roots (with permanent dye) are also looking good.  So I am happy with the color protection aspect of this product.\n\nWith respect to frizz, this isn't doing much.  It doesn't promise to, so I am not going to lower my rating because of that.  But if you are looking for a multifunctional hair product, this might not be it.  (I use detanglers and oils afterwards to control frizz and if you do that, this could still work for you.)  It may be just too difficult to overcome the Georgia summer humidity.  But I still have to use all my anti-frizz products after I wash my hair.\n\nYou can see the full ingredients list on the product page if you zoom in on the images.  It isn't 100% natural or anything like that, but it does have a somewhat less \"chemical\" list of ingredients than a lot of shampoos I've tried.  (For me, that's neither here nor there.  I am primarily concerned that it works and doesn't irritate my scalp or make my hair fall out, and this passes all three of those tests.)\n\nOverall, I like this, but I don't think it is going to end up being THE shampoo for me.", "summary": "good for color protection but I find I have to use quite a lot", "unixReviewTime": 1471910400}

However, after a while of playing around with Drip Dry versus a Quick Dry Topcoat (I use Sally Hanson), I haven't found a situation where it was beneficial to use the drops instead of the topcoat.  A quick dry topcoat also provides \"ding proofing\" fairly quickly, but additionally, later dries to a hard topcoat.  With the drops, I often found myself painting, use Drip Dry, then maybe the next day applying top coat and applying Drip Dry to that... I still wanted my color to be protected. Perhaps if you were using a matte finish polish, or had multi-step nail art that you didn't want to seal in yet then Drip Dry would be the way to go, but otherwise, I'd say go with a rapid dry top coat for sure.\n\n-----------\nOriginal Review:\nI really don't understand the reviews saying this doesn't work, because I find the drops function exactly as the package says - mostly dry after a few minutes, and completely dry after 30 minutes.  My routine the past few weeks has been a base coat, 2 coats of color, Drip Dry drops, and wait 30 minutes (it's completely dry).  Then I apply clear top coat, Drip Dry drops again, and wait 20-ish minutes until I feel like I can go to bed without imprinting them.  When I wake up, my nails are perfect, and drying both the color and top coat with the drops works perfectly. This is a great product, and I will probably keep using it as long as I'm painting my nails.", "summary": "EDIT: Works but Why Not Use Fast Dry Topcoat?", "unixReviewTime": 1364601600}

I keep a very neat beard so my shave has to be pretty accurate and controlled - as opposed to swiping the full naked face.  It's light, even though it has a nice long handle.  It's also a very mildly aggressive razor (read online to learn differences on razor aggressiveness). I quickly learned that it wasn't as aggressive as I'd have liked and the Merker blade wasn't the highest quality.  Overall I'm happy with it and will keep to touch up around my nose and lip areas. It's also good for quick touch up cleaning that I seem to be always doing (too particular, I know), which I tend to do with only a quick splash of water.  I'd suggest anyone getting into the Safety Razor gig to purchase the sample blades that you can get on Amazon.  30 blades (2 per brand) will help you decide what blade is best for you.  I will say that the Feather brand blades are wickedly sharp!  Even in this razor.

To be honest, Nail Envy doesn't do anything for my nails to strengthen them at all, nor does it keep my nail polish on for an extended period of time (I'm talking maybe a day or two if I'm lucky). Before anyone accuses me of \"not doing my nails correctly\", etc. I've always been VERY meticulous about application and procedure. With this base coat, entire sheets of paint pop off through the day and then I'm left with ten little sheets of what look like paper thin press on nails. So as I said, the base coat is nothing to rave about at all. The only reason I'm rating this at three stars is simply for the fact that I still choose this base coat over everything else I own. Why? Because it works better than the other brands I've tried. China glaze, Orly, Essie, Zoya, Deborah Lippmann, Butter London- NONE of them last more than 12 hours on my nails before they either chip beyond repair or fall off entirely.\n\nMaybe this base coat has been beneficial to others who don't suffer from a condition similar to mine, if so then that's awesome!

The finish is incredible!  And the color match is truly amazing.  The light medium is a perfect match for my fair to medium skin.  And five hours later as of now, it doesn't look oily at all.

The make up was not Autumn, it was much lighter.  Within the hour my face became irritated and burned slightly.  Jane Iredale is made in the USA, the label on the bottom of the refill that I received differs from my previous refill.  Unless Jane Iredale lightened their hues, changed the formula and their labels, I doubt the authenticity of what I received. I've wasted $27.00.", "summary": "I am pleased with the price and product! **Update**", "unixReviewTime": 1416182400}

I tried using other brow pencil sharpeners but none worked (they only wore down the tip). The lack of proper sharpener may have affected application but not the other elements (texture, color, look when applied, price/value ratio) that are a part of evaluating this pencil's effectiveness.\n\nI've used a wide variety of eyebrow pencils over the years at a variety of price points. The best are easy to apply in that they don't seem to cake or clump and go on evenly (with a well-sharpened tip) and don't smudge; you can shape the tip as needed to give thicker or thinner lines. The consistency (a bit waxy but not too much), which you can't try before you buy, is a key factor in both application and longevity, once applied.\n\nOther than the color itself, there's nothing that I liked about this product. Which is disappointing as this is a good brand and I've used other Longo products and been satisfied with their performance. It's especially disappointing given the price point.\n\nApplication: Not as easy as other pencils, which is due, in part, I think, to the consistency (waxy, clumpy) and the size of the tip (too small and chubby and not thin enough to my liking).\n\nTexture: Not as smooth as other pencils I've used. Took longer to apply and had to keep smudging and fiddling with Q-tips to get a neat line. Didn't go on \"evenly.\"\n\nLook when applied: Seemed heavier and line was not as strong and consistent. Getting a thin line was very difficult (again, an issue of consistency and size/shape of product tip)\n\nColor: This was a really good color for me, even though I have medium brown hair. I have found that many products labeled \"blonde\" are the right shade either alone or when used to lighten up a darker color.\n\nPrice/Value: Simply not there for me. I've had better application, better looking brows with pencils that were cheaper. But since a person's brows (color, texture, etc.) differ greatly, this may work better for you than me.

This iron is the preferred iron of stylists for a reason-it is a workhorse, and it is fabulous.\n\nI have this iron in three sizes. I have the 1\", the 1.25\" and the 2\". This size is by far my most used size. I have mid back length hair and it's medium thickness. It is wavy by nature but I typically curl it after blow drying it straight. This iron has been my go to after years of use, and it still looks as good as the day I bought it-8 years ago. It's in pristine condition and it works like a charm, and it gets USED.\n\nThere are adjustable settings for the temperature on here-it's a dial-set it once and then leave it alone. Not like electronic ones where you have to reset it every time you use it. I do wish this had an auto off feature, that's my one thing I want that newer irons have. The barrel on here is the PERFECT size for most hair types. It gives the loose barrel curl type, the \"Victoria's Secret Curl\" a lot of girls are after. The longer you hold the curl, the better longevity you will get. I have experimented with this thing for years and gotten tons of variety with it.\n\nThere is a longer barrel version of this floating out there now for women with really long hair, and I feel like while that might be useful, it might be harder to manhandle as well. This works well for me even when my hair has been exceptionally long. I think that had I known to buy this on Amazon back in college, I could have saved some money. The clamp is really strong, and while the iron comes with a replacement spring, I have not needed to replace mine in almost a decade of ownership with heavy usage.\n\nIf you are looking for a quality iron that will last a LONG time and won't leave you penniless, this is worth it.

Instead of calling friends, the first call I made was to my hairdresser. Wouldn't anyone? So I went to my hairdresser who has done every rock star's hair in town, just about, and having rock star hair myself, very curly, I have used many products for curly hair, but never got THESE results that I did with the Chi Polish. My hair designer used the Chi Pliable Polish and mixed a good bit of it with a large amount of Aquage Defining Gel (which is the secret I think) and wrapped it in his hands and smothered it into my wet hair and than diffused it. I don't know if I copied my hairdresser and used a larger than normal amount myself later on and THAT is why it became such a curly masterpiece, but people were complimenting me on the set right up until the time we taped. Because I have extremely curly hair this is the only thing I will use especially if I am going out. I know using the right amount makes it rock n roll- stage ready, and my hair cooks. I am in my 40's and no longer stand with my hands around a blow dryer for an hour. I mix a good amount of the Chi Polish with the Aquage Gel, diffuse for maybe 5 min--and I am ready to go. If you do not use enough there is definitely a difference, so you need to make sure to use a sufficiant. I was afraid using the amount I did would make my hair sticky, but my hair guy DID say to use a lot and it doesn't make anything sticky. This product is incredible and if I have to do my own hair and makeup for future media events, I definitely do my hair with that combination. I won't go on camera without it.

But color me impressed.\n\nShea butter is the 2nd ingredient after the \"juices\".  Because of this, the texture is actually a delight -- imagine shea butter diluted down to an emulsion, creating a thin, flexible, protective film on your face that acts as a barrier/primer.  It has that matte drydown often found in shea, but is much thinner and lighter -- the slight firming sensation acts as a temporary \"freeze\" while filling in pores and fine lines. Amazingly, I found it effective as a wind chafing barrier, cushioning my face from the biting cold. I love that it is non-oily in texture, allowing me to layer stuff over it. No pilling at all -- compatible with your other serums/sunscreens/foundations.\n\nNow, a moisturizer that simply hydrates is not good enough! we demand more from our products these days. To show truly efficacious results, this cream has to DO something else. That's where the AHA's come in. The fruit acids to act as low level AHA's (i'd guess it's 5% or less), so you won't see visible brightness overnight -- but over a few weeks, you'll feel your skin texture getting smoother, more refined.\n\nThe AHA's are crucial in this product because without them, your dead skin cells would just accumulate, and the lipid ingredients in this cream would simply bind those dead cells together, causing dullness and clogs. Also it is silicone-free (silicone is notorious for causing clogs), and it has other \"good-for-you\" nutrients like antioxidants and DMAE. But really--it's the AHA's that do the most.\n\nIn summary, this formulation is a good combo of light AHA's and hydrating ingredients while steering clear of the \"no-no\"s. If you are looking for an immediate refining/ brightening effect, only a professional peel or IPL/laser treatment would do that; i'd recommend this cream as a good \"maintenance\" cream that gradually further refines skin on a slower basis, albeit much gentler.", "summary": "A beauty industry insider's professional  opinion: good combo of low % AHAs with hydrating ingredients, gradual skin refining", "unixReviewTime": 1416614400}

I am 35 years of age and have a full head of hair and according to my family history won't lose it anytime soon,  so I can not explain how the shampoo does on thinning hair, but with the results I got from it just using a quarter sized amount to wash my hair and beard, I would be shocked if it didn't do what it advertises for those with thinning hair.  Even though it is $19 for 12 ounces,  I will be buying this product from now on.", "summary": "The Man of the House Loves It", "unixReviewTime": 1413676800}

It adds body and texture without weighing my hair down.  It also adds some heft to individual strands making them look thicker and more voluminous.  I've started layering this spray with a styling spray (Suave) because my hair is really hard to hold and I found that I needed some extra support in order for my finished style to last a couple of days.  The two products work well together and there's no stiffness or crunchiness at all. But you don't have to do this because this spray works well all by itself.  I have a layered long bob (a lob) and I wanted something that would define the layers while adding some heft to my tresses.  This spray gives me incredible body and my hair is light and bouncy and responds really well to styling.  I let my hair air dry overnight and use a curling iron in the a.m. to create beachy waves.  This spray is definitely activated by heat and the volume increases as heat is applied but if you just want texture, you don't have to use heat at all. I really like this spray and its thickening properties and its ability to give my hair loads of swingy body.  It was a good purchase for me.  Amazon has the best price on this product btw.  My local Ulta sells this spray for $16 and I think I paid $10ish on Amazon Prime.  I definitely recommend this spray, especially for fine hair.

I used this product the first day with some no-rinse body wash. It was okay. I had to put my hair up, but it was definitely better than not using anything at all.\n\nThis product works a LOT better than Batiste and Algermarin. It's a tiny bottle, but you don't have to use very much, whereas most other dry shampoos are sprays, and you have to use a lot. I've had this little bottle since April 2011, and there's still half in it. I don't use it everyday, of course...only for emergencies.\n\nThe application is sort of awkward, but, like I said, it's better than sprays.

I did hours of research only to find that it is a very difficult condition to manage. Some people stated they were on antibiotics for years and years. His hair was falling out with the inflammation and he was so afraid that he would lose all his hair and be left with a awful appearing scalp. We both hesitated going to a dermatologist because we didn't want him to start on courses of antibiotics with no end in sight.\nHe started using Therapro Mediceuticals Thera Rx Anti Bacterial Scalp and Skin Wash, also purchased on Amazon, as a pre shower treatment. Then he would shower using Paul Mitchell as a shampoo. These were used simultaneously from day 1 so we are not sure if one product is superior to the other.\nThe results are nothing short of miraculous. Within the first fee days he had a ton of drying and flaking. The pus filled bumps were drying up and literally falling off his head. He continued to use both treatments for about 2 weeks. He has also been taking orally a probiotic, curcumin and oil of oregano capsules to work this from the inside as well.\nMerely 2 weeks later his scalp is over 90% healed and he has no pain or itchiness. He will maintain this daily regimen at least one more week.\nThe beauty of these products is they will fight both bacterial and fungal infections.\nIf you are suffering please give this a try. I never take the time to write reviews but feel so strongly about his success that I want to help anyone who might be suffering. Good luck.\n\nUpdate - a few week after initial post and absolutely zero folliculitis remaining.

One reviewer noted that she did not like the smell, but I actually received several compliments from my husband when I first started using it, so it is truly a matter of preference. I would describe the smell as a light musky/sweet scent. I tried the WEN cleansers because in the last few years my scalp has become very sensitive and I was shedding more daily. My dermatologist recommended alternating dandruff shampoos, and when that didn't work (and actually irritated my scalp a lot more) she recommended trying shampoos & conditioners with no added fragrance/color etc... None of this worked and costed a small fortune. Then I came across a review from a lady complaining about similar ailments and no luck with the same above routine. She was eventually diagnosed with an allergy to laurel/lauryl sulfates - common shampoo ingredients and which many people are sensitive to. After using the WEN cleansers she noticed a positive difference in her scalp health and daily shedding returned to a normal amount. I have to say that I have had the same positive experience! (Although, for me the Lavender WEN cleanser caused my scalp to feel a little itchy. So I recommend trying the travel sized sets to find the best one for you). One final note is that the WEN cleansing conditioners really do clean your hair and scalp (something I was skeptical about when I first discovered this product due to it lacking detergents).

When I used it, it left a white cast on my skin that I had to rub in for 5 minutes before it looked acceptable, and then it still gave me the oily sunscreen look.\nAnother negative aspect is the intense smell of this product. It smells like citronella mosquito candles. Even my husband noticed and disliked it. They really should have just made this product fragrance free.\n\nBut there is good news: First of all, the scent evaporates after a little while.\n\n Secondly, my face didn't feel dried out after wearing this product all day (unlike other sunscreen products that left my face feeling parched).\n\nThirdly, Juice Beauty uses high quality natural ingredients that won't overload your body with toxins like so many other mainstream sunscreens. I was also really impressed with the high zinc oxide content (this is the ingredient that provides the actual physical sunblock). 20% zinc oxide is much higher than I have seen in any other sunscreen. Zinc is very powerful when it comes to skin healing and is often used for speeding up skin repair and healing sores etc. So I would assume (I haven't used it long enough to see evidence) if you use this product regularly that it could improve your overall skin condition. Also, the high zinc content ensures that this moisturizer serves its stated purpose and actually shields your face from the harmful rays of the sun.\n\nSo, if you are mainly looking for a high quality sunscreen (which I was) then this is a good choice, but don't buy this if you are mostly looking for a moisturizer or you'll be disappointed.", "summary": "Not a moisturizer", "unixReviewTime": 1402099200}

I was a bit overwhelmed by the opposing views/advice to newbies, and ultimately bought this one because I figured it was German, so at least well made (...and I hate stereotypes too). I was hesitant in general to switch because I still have images of my dad leaving the bathroom after shaving looking as if he'd been in a knife fight and just accepted that I'd nick myself a lot as the beginning. Man, I was wrong...\n\nThe first shave was so incredibly easy. I went slowly and had watched videos on line (thanks Manticore59 and Thomas of Denmark on YouTube). Although I didn't get a very close shave on my first try (only did one pass), it was adequate and with a single nick. I have thick growth and coarse hair, and shave my head as well. Initially thought I'd master shaving my face before moving on to my head. But shaving my face was pleasing that I took the plunge and did the dome--no nicks there also.\n\nI've gotten better in the week since and now get an incredibly close shave that surpasses anything I've gotten using Gillette or Schick's high-end razors.

I have been a fan of La Roche-Posay products for many years and was very much looking forward to trying out this new cleanser. But here is what I found:\n\n- Cleansing power is average, not good, not bad, and so is the slightly dry feeling after product usage.\n\n- The company says that it has a \"unique cooling effect for a refreshing, pure feel\". While I did notice a slight cooling effect, I don't think that it amounted to much at all. I definitely expected something stronger than just a very mild and very fleeting cool feeling.\n\n- But what really, really made me dislike this product is that it is heavily fragranced (at least to my nose). I wouldn't say anything if this were Lancome or Estee Lauder - both companies that seem to use a lot of fragrance in their products. But this is La Roche-Posay - a company that advertises products for sensitive skin and calls itself the dermatologists' brand! In the product description on their website they describe it as being \"Soap-free, Alcohol-free, Paraben-free, Safe for sensitive skin\". What they forgot to mention is that they added tons of fragrance to this. While the product rinses off ok, the fragrance does not and I could not wait to use some toner to wipe off every trace of this smell that was way too intense for me and that I plain hated.\n\nWhile I will continue to love&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/La-Roche-Posay-Toleriane-Fluid-1-35-Ounces/dp/B000IO6NFE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">La Roche-Posay Toleriane Fluid  1.35-Ounces</a>&nbsp;precisely because it is fragrance-free and just all-around great for sensitive skin, I am still wondering what La Roche-Posay was thinking when they came up with this Cleansing Gel.

It does have some hold, which is good because my hair is resistant to holding products.  It also does a decent job of protecting my hair from heated styling tools.  However, Redken Iron Shape 11 or Hot Sets 22 works better than this product.  Iron Shape allows natural movement and has great hold all while providing thermal protection and adding shine.  My hair never gets stiff, sticky or crunchy and it looks like hair, not like pageant hair or helmet head.  Hot Off The Press tends to flake and will definitely get stiff if you over spray it.  Iron Shape never does that and my waves last several days.  Hot Sets 22 has twice the hold of Iron Shape and is great if you use hot rollers and want your curls to last for a couple of days at least.  For someone with hard to hold hair like mine, these two Redken products are a godsend.  I don't know why I decided I needed to try Hot Off The Press, I guess I was curious and was encouraged by all the positive reviews.  Don't get me wrong it's a decent product but these two Redken products are much better.  I apply Iron Shape liberally to clean damp hair and then let it air dry overnight.  In the morning, it's not stiff or sticky and I can easily get a brush through it.  I then use a curling iron to create loose waves.  I run a brush through the curls just once and they spring back into shape immediately and last several days.  If I need to recurl, I simply spray some additional Iron Shape, which doesn't build up or have any residue. I can't do that with Hot Off The Press.  I am returning HOTP to Ulta and exchanging it for more Iron Shape.  I was using Living Proof No Frizz Weightless Styling Spray but discovered Iron Shape during my search for a less expensive dupe.  Iron Shape is half the price of LP and provides thermal protection whereas LP does not.  Iron Shape also adds a nice sheen that doesn't look at all greasy or oily.  As far as I'm concerned Iron Shape is a perfect product.  If you want thermal protection with hold, then Iron Shape is the product for you.  There were too many things about HOTP that I didn't like and nothing not to like with Iron Shape, it even smells amazing.  I don't recommend Hot Off The Press at all.

The oil hydrates well, started to soften my skin within 24 hours, and within 2 weeks I have healthy cuticles that are now healed and well-hydrated.\n\nWhen I did receive the cuticle oil the bottle was much smaller than I anticipated.

I purchased the new Dyson hair dryer (already own other Dyson products and love the brand) and this one.  Ended up returning the Dyson and keeping this guy.  When used it on low, which is pretty potent already, this hair dryer doesn't have the annoying high-pitched noise the Dyson has (that can trigger my migraines).  The noise levels coming from this unit in my bedroom measured 73 dB when used on low, and 77 dB when used on high. For reference, I have tile flooring and just a small area rug so not a whole lot around to dampen noise.  If a quieter hair dryer is important to you, you might want to give this a try.  When used on high, it has a bit of a high pitched noise (as you would with any small fan, hence my issue with the Dyson hair dryer) but still not as bad as the Dyson.  The Dyson measured 77 db on the lowest setting in my bedroom, and it had the high-pitched noise that is extremely annoying to me.\nIt heats up really fast and it can get really hot so I typically use it on low heat/low fan, and it takes about 10 minutes to dry my hair (which is fairly long, almost to the middle of my back).\nI am very pleased with this product.  My only complaints are its weight, and that it is not dual voltage so I can't take it with me when I travel abroad as most other countries don't use 110V.

Its a beautiful color, really unique and perfect as we go into Fall!\n\nThe color may best be described as a deep purple! It is a deep inky color. I cured the base coat for about 2 minutes, as I find this works better than the time suggested on the bottle which is in seconds, then applied 2 coats curing each for 2 minutes! It needs the 2 coats as the color is a little faint and washed out with just one application! Then followed with a generous coat of the Shellac top coat!\n\nThe result: pretty and shiny nails, I have been wearing this color for 10 days and still no peeling or chipping! It looks as shiny as the first day I applied it and the color is still vibrant!  It is really a cool modern color and will look great for Fall  / Winter and a great party idea for Halloween! It is pretty dark so worth noting!\n\nTo remove I find the easiest thing is to get a small bowl, fill with some acetone and soak for about 6-10 minutes, it simply melts off with no problem!", "summary": "Amazing color with great staying power!", "unixReviewTime": 1313884800}

As long as I soak off the CND gel thoroughly with pure acetone, there have been no issues. Do not scrape residuals off. Let the acetone do the work. Make sure all layers are removed. If your nail looks shiny, the base coat has not been completely removed. Then soak longer. When applying the gel, be sure to apply one coat of the base, 2 coats of shellac, one top coat, and cure according to the directions between each coat. Be sure to seal the edges of each coat or you may get water between the coats and your nail, which may result in a nail fungus. If applied properly, it will last 2 weeks. I would not advise keeping it on longer than this due to the breakdown of the shellac, and nail exposure to water infiltration. Love this brand.

This lasercomb can be promising to many if you take the time and have the knowledge to use it correctly. Its not a miracle cure. This device works when used with a combination of shampoo and supplements. Do your research. The laser comb needs help to be effective. Its a 3 step process. First you want to get a specialized  shampoo and this one came highly recommended by a doctor friend of mine...  Pura d or. Kind of a tricky name but I did spell it correctly. Get the hair loss formula as it comes in different formulas. Its an organic shampoo with no harsh chemicals and only the best ingredients, some of which are responsible for stopping/slowing hair loss. It can be found on Amazon. This shampoo by itself(WHEN USED PROPERLY) will stop(not regrow) hair loss in most people. Its not a 2 week fix. It takes months to see results. Patience is a virtue. There is also a product called HLCC Scripts Complete. Its a 30 or 90 day supply of supplements that inhibits the DHT in your scalp. DHT is an enzyme in your scalp that causes the hair follicles to shrink and eventually fall out. Eliminate the DHT and your hair will fight back. This supplement is not cheap, but it is the best and it WORKS. Myskincenter dot com is where I get mine. Now you have a 3 fold plan and you are attacking your hair loss both internally and externally.\n\nNow for the laser comb. Neat little device that provides a soft non irritating laser bath to the scalp.  When used in conjunction with the above you should see positive regrowth in 4 to 6 months. Is it gonna work for everyone? No, some people are just not going to get results. But I consider it a chance worth taking for me and the odds are on your side that you will see positive results over time.  I bought the most powerful laser comb because you have to use it less(8 minutes as appose to 12 or 15 with the other models) because of the more powerful laser. I have been using it 4 times a week and my hair loss has stopped. I have type 1 male pattern baldness for which I am lucky. I am looking forward to future regrowth. Its only been about 60 days. I am seeing results though as far as no more hair loss. This is very cool. I will update in the upcoming months. Also if you choose to buy a laser comb watch the price as it fluctuates by as much as a hundred dollars. I got lucky and paid 370 dollars. The next day it was 440 dollars.\n\nFinally, I am in no way associated with any of these products, I fly jets for a living, its just that I have confidence in my research and the hair regrowth issue is such a touchy,misunderstood topic. If you are gonna blast the product because you think it is gonna be some miracle cure for hair thinning, educate yourself first and give the lasercomb a fighting chance.", "summary": "Works if you have a plan", "unixReviewTime": 1363824000}

The scent (grapefruit variety) is nice: gender-neutral, not too fruity or sweet, and more complex than what you'd usually pick up at the drugstore. It's not a particular favorite, but should have broad appeal. I really don't notice it once I'm out of the shower, though.\n\nThe bottle is attractive, and gives the impression of something you'd find in a nice hotel. The pump isn't especially convenient, though. I need about five pumps to produce enough lather for a whole wash; each pump is small so I don't feel it's a large amount, just an inconvenient process. You'll also be bent over if you don't have a shower ledge at a comfortable height. It needs to be resting on something since you'll need one hand to hold a sponge and another to work the pump top. All that to say, the packaging seems luxe, but I don't actually like it better than an average squeeze bottle.\n\nThis might be a good choice if you want something that looks extra fancy, or happen to know you LOVE one of the scents.

It comes out of the pump feeling like a gel, but when spread on the skin, it more or less just disappears.  And to top it off, the pump stopped functioning when the bottle was about 2/3 empty.

I (somewhat) alternate between not shaving, electric razor and mach-3 blade, depending on the occasion. I like using the electric because it's quick and less messy. But the effectiveness of the electric varies depending on the humidity. This gel helps the electric provide a consistent and even shave, without any burn. I am VERY pleased with the results from two electric shaves so far. Whether I'll use the gel in addition to the cream with a blade shave I haven't decided. I will have to try it a few more times to see if it adds value for me. I will also check the Amazon price for the next bottle because right now it's $3 cheaper than the mall store or online.\n\nNote that this is NOT an oil. I do NOT recommend using the oil with an electric razor. This gel washes out of the electric head easily. The oil does NOT (emphasis intentional).

It is warming, which is nice and has a light lather, smells good as well. My face feels extremely soft after using it. The bottling may be it's only downfall. It seems to be slightly heavy compared to other bottles, so it is hard to tell how much product is in there. So I am slightly concerned that when it gets low I will not know and will not be able to order/buy it in stores when I need it. Also, because of this possibly, I find that it is a not a bottle to be used in the shower.

But for the price asked, I have to say the value drops off.  In my opinion, this product performs nearly identically to Kiss My Face Moisture Shave.  I can't tell any difference between the two lathers other than scent.  However KMF gives you a lot more product for a lot less money.\n\nIt's easy to use, just shake out a wet brush and start swirling on the soap.  You can't really overload the brush, but you can under-load it, so be aware of that.  I usually load for 30-60 seconds on a damp brush.  If you're creating excessive foam while loading, the brush is too wet.  Take that to your bowl, hand or face to whip up an easy shave ready lather.  This stuff does lather very easily, and it's very easy to find its sweet spot without overshooting it.\n\nIt provides a reasonably protective lather.  It whips up thick and feels very creamy, substantial, and provides good glide and cushion when properly hydrated.  I don't typically have any irritation issues with this product, but do occasionally open up a weeper on my neck where I have difficult spots to shave.  The lather rinses easily and doesn't clog the razor.  I typically shave a whole cheek or one side of my neck between rinses and don't have issues with clogging at all.\n\nThe scent is minimal, hardly noticable in my opinion, but it has a good clean soapy/antiseptic smell.  The eucalyptus oil is the prevalent scent, so if you've smelled that before, you'll have a pretty good idea.  The menthol is minimal as well.  I don't personally notice any cooling effect whatsoever.  I could name a product or two with really excellent menthol presence.  I wouldn't put this one on the list.\n\nMoisturizing? It doesn't dry me out, but at the same time I don't feel hydrated after a shave.  I would rate this as neutral.  Not bad, not great either.  It just gets the job done.  I follow this with an aftershave balm to lock down any dry skin issues.\n\nAll in all, I can see why so many people appreciate the product.  It's easy to use, and does a pretty good job.  And it's not terribly expensive.  But for the money, there's better value to be had.  I strongly suggest you try out Kiss My Face products.  The pump bottles look like hand soap dispensers, but the product inside performs almost identically to this one, perhaps a bit more moisturizing, and with all natural ingredients, not to mention at a much better price per ounce.", "summary": "Decent Shaving Cream...", "unixReviewTime": 1391385600}

Based on past experiences with hair brushes and hot air brushes (and I have been using them since high school - I'm now 34), metal barrels ALWAYS work better and hold up a lot better. So today I showered, applied my styling product and threw my hair up before since I didn't have time to dry it before getting my kids from school. Normally I have to blow dry and use a hot air brush to get my desired look, but this did it all. I was expecting much by the time I used it since I didn't get to blow dry my hair. It was only about 75% dried and I have a lot of natural wave/curl. However in about 15 minutes I had the look I usually get after 30 minutes of blow drying and using a curling iron. Not to mention it straightened the little annoying waves around my face that usually take me forever to straighten out, and there almost no frizz.

I owned a Hot Tools titanium curling iron that just went bust on me and thought what can go wrong with getting the same brand. Well...there is a big difference in how this handles compared to the previous one. The clamp handle is high and difficult to push down with one finger as the spring is tough, which leads to jerky hand movements when trying to run this through strands to create a curl. In spite of the strong spring, when you reach the end of your strand one of two things happen: the hair just slides out of clamp and you have to start the curl all over again; or, the hair just snags at the base of the clamp in the spring and you just have to tug and unravel the curl to set it loose and start again.\nI got extremely frustrated trying to curl my hair several times and just did not get a good smooth experience. It is heavier than my previous curling iron and more cumbersome to operate. If you are looking for a basic curling iron and don't mind getting clamp creases and having hand cramps from trying to open and close that clamp, only to have your strands sliding out as your trying to get the curl set....then get this one. I will return it and look for another one.", "summary": "Not professional quality - just a basic curling iron", "unixReviewTime": 1424649600}

Not just a little had come out in manufacturing, it was a lot. This alone wouldn't have really bothered me, as I am not super picky, but as I squeezed it to try some out....nothing. I had to flatten down the top 2/3 of the tube in order to get anything out. Literally. It looked and felt full at first only because it was full of air.\nNow I know that a lot of products will have a bit of air in them, like the classic bagged chips, but really I would say I have less than two tablespoons of product left in this tube. Its as if I had been using it for 3 months, not as if I bought it brand new for $30.

Who doesn't need a translucent powder for a mid day oil blot? I only have one refillable compact so I took my foundation powder out of that compact, since I only apply that at home in the morning, and immediately put in the translucent powder in it to carry with me and all seemed fine and dandy. The product itself was a bit dissapointing in that the application with a powder brush applied WAY too much product and the translucent color was very pasty and dull. But all Jane products do really have a bit of a learning curve when you are first using them. So I decided instead to try the sponge that came with it to touch up my face throughout the day. This worked better and the oil from the day was in fact blotted away, though too much product was still used! I actually kept the plactic cover on the powder and exposed only about an 8th of the product before dabbing th sponge on the product and then blotting my face. Now on to the problems that prompt the \"What the HECK?!\"\n\nI am very protective of my products, especially considering how expensive they are, and have taken very good care of this compact. But about a month after having the powder (and using it a total of 6 or 7 times and having it protected in the METAL compact!!) the powder began to separate and pieces began to flake off. Thinking it was not a big deal, I continued on in my normal fashion of carying the compact with me. Day by day, the small flakes began to turn into larger pieces that were essetnially becoming un-pressed. At one point, I attempted to repress some of the larger pieces back together and this worked for a few days. Now the entire disc of powder looks like a piece of earth in the driest of dry deserts - full of cracks and dust and completely ruined. I cannot carry the compact anymore. I cannot take the disc out fo the compact unless I want to do it over the trash can and eat the cost of the make-up because it is so shattered. I cannot use the product anymore because as a pressed powder it applied too heavy and as a shattered poweder it is a disaster!\n\nI am going to attempt to get my money back for this pressed powder train wreck, but fear that, awesome as Amazon is, this is going to be a huge headache that will cost me money and time...neither of which can ge replaced.\n\nSo my best course of action is to caution all of you loyal Jane Iredale users to not buy this! Or if you do, be very careful with the powder!!", "summary": "What the HECK?!", "unixReviewTime": 1388275200}

I find it to gives me a very smooth finish and I absolutely love that it lasts all day and it doesn't make me greasy.

So to find something that doesn't make me an oil slick AND that stays until I wash it off is amazing.  I do use a bit of MakeUp For Ever's HD powder to fill in any open pores that this doesn't cover and I'm good to go.

I have long, very thick curly hair, that I tended to blow straight a lot, or wore in a bun that never fully dried (because my hair is that thick).  In the interest of spicing things up (and looking more professional at work),  I invested in an Elchim and the Cocooon Diffuser.  I am so elated with my purchase.\n\nIn the distant past I used the standard long-tooth diffuser.  Though I used as instructed, my hair at the roots dried in a frizzy mess or poofed out too much.  The Elchim diffuser makes my curls stay in tact.  I must add that while I have thick hair, my individual strands are semi-coarse and tend to be thin.  Thought you might like this information for added perspective).\n\nIt took some time understanding how to use the cocoon part.  I learned hat this works wonderfully when pressed against the scalp  at at 90 degree angle (low setting, cold to medium heat -- depending on how dry my hair is).  For those who have a lot of natural volume and don't want that 80's look, this product is a must have!  It keeps hair near the scalp wavy or spiraled.  The curl at the ends stays healthy too.\n\nI can now sport my curls with glee.  Thank goodness for the Elchim diffuser.  (note: I use this on their legacy blow dryner, Elchim 2001 HP -- I also highly recommend this dryer for curly hair.  It's ionic and the cool setting is an actually setting, and not a cold shot, so you can relax your thumb as you cool set).  Nice!\n\nUpdate:  The instructions are weak on how to remove the top part.  It took me an exchange, several lost nails, and bruised knuckles to figure out that to remove the cocoon top you need to put the whole apparatus on its (on your lap, preferably).  Push down on one of the perforated sides and then gently pull off.  The instructions claim that you can push the sides in simultaneously -- that's nearly humanly impossible unless you are in competition for the world's longest fingers.", "summary": "Compact and Deliver results", "unixReviewTime": 1392595200}

I wanted to do a gel for vacation but couldn't bring myself to spend all that money at a salon (especially since I never think they do a better job than me and I have hundreds of colors here.) After 2 days of researching, I settled on this topcoat. My two requirements were it had to last and it had to work with regular polish. I'm putting it to the test. It's been one day, I will update in a week with new results\n\nBase coat: Nailtiques (formula 2)\nPolish: Essie pret-a-surfer\nTopcoat: Vinylux\n\nThe Essie applies beautifully with one coat however while applying the topcoat, the polish became streaky so a second coat was added and the topcoat went on without a hitch thereafter. It took a while to dry completely (over an hour) and even then I didn't know if it would last through the night because it still felt a little off. My first time using this product so I didn't know if that was normal or not, but I woke up without any blanket creases and it feels like a regular polish now. My nails overall feel very strong as if I had wraps on. I have high hopes right now, but lets see if it can withstand the mom of two preschoolers life I live.\n\n*****Update: it's been 48 hours; a trip to the mall, a trip to the grocery store, 8 loads of laundry, 3 sinks full of dishes, broke down about about a dozen boxes for the recycling, half a dozen showers (twins included) and general household cleaning/cooking and at the end of the weekend 1 nail chipped within 24 hours and 2 after 48....the rest are dulled with scratches.

It took a few tries to make it work, but I have grown to love Vinylux.\n\nI have tried various ways of applying this, but thin coats of color (2-3) with 2 coats of this product, the Vinylux topcoat, seems to work best for me. In my experience, base coats cause this to chip prematurely so I would advise against using them, as this must bond directly to the nail for it to be effective.\n\nThis can be removed with regular acetone/polish remover, which is another big advantage over gel. I would advise this to anyone looking for a longer lasting polish without the damaging effects of gel polish, and no UV light required!\n\nIf I haven't raved about it enough, probably the greatest thing about this system is how quickly it dries compared to regular nail polish. Gone are the days of sitting in front of a fan for 30 minutes only to still smudge my polish. By the time I am ready to apply the second coat, the first is completely dry. After applying the final top coat, it will be dry and smudge free in under 10 minutes, just as CND claims.\n\nTo summarize, I truly believe in the Vinylux system and would recommend it to anyone. This polish costs the same as most regular polishes but has many added benefits. Definitely worth the try.", "summary": "Great nail polish system", "unixReviewTime": 1418083200}

It is nothing less than magical how the polish/top set without any light or special salon machines.  I got hooked on Vinylux after getting a salon mani/pedi and learning about this amazing product.  I called around locally but it is impossible to purchase anywhere other than on Amazon.  Though it killed me to wait what seemed like an eternity for the polishes to arrive, it was so worth it!\nI have a two and half year old son (read: bathing him, cleaning up, and wear and tear on my nails), as well as packing my house up to move (read: boxes packing tape getting stuck on nails and pulled off and really, really tough wear on my nails).  My manicure that I gave myself with Vinylux polish and top coat has lasted a full week!!!  There are a few small pieces of polish chipped at the end, but it really is nothing to notice and that is with Rubble (a dark grey) which would be very obvious.  I probably could leave this polish on for another few days if it was necessary.  The thing that makes me want to repaint is the growth from my cuticles!!!\nBe sure to have some sort of cuticle gel/moisturizer as that is a frustrating difference of a salon mani vs. doing your nails yourself.  Also, be sure to wait the recommended time between the polish coats and top coat.

I used this exact product when I had my newborn to help with cradle cap and because a little goes a long way (especially on my fairly bald baby), I ended up giving it to a friend when she had her baby and I thought I was done with it.\n\nUnfortunately as my daughter was out in the sun more, her scalp apparently dried out more and she started having pretty good sized flakes again.  My pediatrician said it was cradle cap but that I could use Head n' Shoulders.  I did and it didn't help.  I used Coconut oil and that didn't help.  I used this product and it seemed to get better but wasn't gone completely.  Then I put some hair oil on her scalp for about 30 minutes and washed it out with this foaming shampoo and voila!  Great scalp again!\n\nI still use this formula every night and have yet to have a flare up again.  And the bottle seems to last forever.  I know it's on the pricey side but we've been using this every other night for months and I think I still have half the bottle left.\n\nOh, I also recommend their bath oil.

Calling this little tube of perfection 'make-up', is an understatement- it's also a treatment. Eyeko eyebrow gel helps prevent the premature fallout of eyebrow hairs and keeps them nourished and maintained with good-for-you, quality ingredients:). So far, this eyebrow gel has given me the most natural eyebrow look , I've ever achieved. Besides the before-mentioned reason, as to why this product rocks, it makes the eyes pop. It's a slightly darker shade than I'm used to, despite it being a universal tint. I'd always hated deep pigmented eyebrow make-up, due to the harsh looking effect. This product is an exception. The results are so natural and keeps my eyebrows in place all day, so basically it works out beautifully in the end. To say that I'm blown away by Eyeko, is an understatement. Here is the only itty-bitty thing that I find slightly taxing....I feel that in order to gain a more perfected & complete brow look, I must use the tip of an eyebrow brush to stroke the brows w/ light feathery moves in the same direction (this coats all hairs). Then, I need to proceed with a pointed tip cosmetic q-tip to blend in the gel and reduce excess of product build-up. After, I make sure to use the q-tip to swipe any slight mess, edge and/or unevenness. I'd say the last steps are a wee bit taxing....but totally and absolutely worth it!! Overall, I think I've fallen in love with Eyeko. It may sound quite bizarre, but I actually look forward towards the mornings so that I can use my eye gel. I cannot recommend this product enough to someone looking to achieve the most perfect and natural brow look! :) Btw, I don't recommend this for non-brunettes!:)", "summary": "I've finally come across the best eyebrow makeup ever", "unixReviewTime": 1411430400}

You can read all you want about top notes, middle notes, and bottom, but I never found text descriptions to be useful, and even if they were, fragrances react uniquely with your personal skin chemistry. The way it smells on you is different than the way it smells on someone else. And you can't just spray the fragrance on a tester strip. You have to apply it your skin.\n\nWith that having been said, let's get down to talking about this MONTBLANC EDT. Both the bottle design and scent are very similar to&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Guilty-By-Gucci-EDT-spray-for-Men-3-Ounce/dp/B004O24Q8W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Guilty By Gucci EDT spray for Men, 3 Ounce</a>. If you like Guilty, you may find this comparable. The spiciness is a bit like&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Lancome-La-Vie-Est-Belle-L-Eau-de-Parfum-Spray-3-4-Ounce/dp/B00I7PK3GQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Lancome La Vie Est Belle L'Eau de Parfum Spray, 3.4 Ounce</a>&nbsp;(a woman's fragrance).\n\nWith a name like Intense, you'd expect this to be, well, intense. It's not. The scent is very milquetoast. It's pleasant, but very subtle and short-lived. I applied a \"stream\" of it my forearm about 15 minutes ago and cannot smell it anymore. My arm is about 2 ft from my nose as I sit typing. I said \"stream\" because the nozzle design is terrible. It does not spray out as a mist. It comes out as a stream of liquid.\n\nThis is probably an intentional decision -- it makes you use more of the product, and therefore, you will deplete the bottle quicker. You'll also need to use a lot more of it to get the same coverage effect compared to other EDTs with a higher concentration of essential oils.  I work in the beauty industry and I'm around fragrances all day (but on the web technology side), for what that's worth. Higher quality fragrances have a higher concentration of \"essential oils\". I suspect that percentage is very low here, given the very short scent lifetime. Contrast this with&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Issey-Miyake-L-eau-D-issey-4-2-Ounce-Edt-Spray/dp/B002CT3PXG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Issey Miyake L'eau D'issey 4.2 Ounce Edt Spray</a>, which I think is a much better buy and performance ratio, ounce for ounce. One spritz and I smell nice ALL DAY. It's understated, but long lasting. My wife loves it and every time I come home from work, she remarks on how much she loves that scent.\n\nLastly, I love the bottle design, but don't like how short the cap is. If you put this in a gym bag or luggage, it'll easy come uncapped.\n\nOverall, it's a good, clean, if short-lived, scent. If you're thinking about buying it, I highly recommend you go to someplace like Sephora to try it out in person first. And while you're there, try out the other 2 men's fragrances I mentioned. Buy it online at another store though. You can find this fragrance for almost 1/3 the price on a popular site.", "summary": "A short-lived and milquetoast scent", "unixReviewTime": 1458345600}

I have medium-long, thin, and naturally straight hair. I have the kind of hair that gets greasy about every 3-4 days and needs to be washed but if washed every day then it begins to dry. It also becomes dry in cold weather or if I don't do a weekly oil mask. My type of hair is thin but strong...however, I finally done did it with the bleach and coloring damage. I have not commited to any hair products before because I found that they did not do much or made my hair greasy. After severely damaging my hair I pretty much needed to find a product if I wasn't going to cut it all off. A hair stylist recommended this product for this hair type. I was skeptical but after she applied her sample on my hair I noticed that it was very light! A non-heavy hair lotion that you can also use as a hair detangler if you like having long hair and it gets knotted up. In general I feel that this does everything it advertises. I have actually commited to using this one and noticed improvement in my hair as well as relief in caring for my hair. The texture is very watery, so I would not recommend it to someone with thick and/or curly hair as you might not get enough moisture with this one, but for the hair type that I described it works well.

(Nothing says \"un-sexy\" and \"stay away\" than an infected eyeball, no matter how much you dress up it's curtains!) I usually put a drop onto a q-tip or brush, and then apply it over eye shadow to \"finish\" up the look since it makes it look metallic and catches the light in a way no other products do. These liquid eye finishes make eyes pop and stand out from the ordinary, but are more for special occasions unless you are using the tiniest bit as an inner eye corner highlight. You can also use these over mascara for a striking effect, and I've added it to hair oils or lotions to give them a glittery sheen. While I've tried to see if it can be used as a lip additive, (not an intended use as far as I know, so add it to things or use it \"off label\" at your own risk) but the consistency doesn't work for this well and it tastes bad.

Its price point may be a little higher than many usual face creams, but I find I use a lot less, adhering to those 5 small point application techniques:  One dot respectively on the forehead, nose, right and left cheeks, and chin. I have used a light dot around the sensitive eye area with no adverse consequences.\n\nUsing it this way, one jar lasts about 3.5 months.\n\nL'OCCITANE IMMORTELLE DIVINE FACE CREAM goes on easily and  spreads well.  The scent is reminiscent of a light floral/citrus/pear combination. The texture of the cream is rich and nourishing and is readily absorbed, without any excessive greasiness. The pillowcase never has any greasy residue on it as can happen with other night creams. I find that this face cream is well tolerated as no redness, blotchiness, nor rashes have ever developed after months of use.  Additionally, this face cream does not appear to be comedogenic (pimple causing) at all. That often happens when a face cream is too greasy, not well absorbed and just 'sits' on top of your skin, trapping in the bacteria (Propionibacterium acnes)  that can cause pimple development.\n\nTrap in moisture in your skin by lightly cleansing the face with clear water prior to application of the cream. This habit can be especially helpful after a shower.\n\nL'Occitane Immortelle Divine Face Cream can be used well with most skin care regimens.\n\nWith all new skin care products, Patch Testing is usually recommended: before zealous application, apply a small amount to an area you can monitor (such as the under belly of the forearm).  If no itching or redness develops, it is not likely that an allergy has occurred. you might then want to try more liberal use and greater distribution. But, when in doubt, always stop use and consult a physician.\n\nThis super face cream works very nicely as a night cream.\n\nIt's just a really fine face cream. Highly recommended!\n\nUPDATE:\n\nAfter many weeks of use, the face seems brighter and more alert. Any dark circles under the eyes have visibly diminished and there is no puffiness around the eyes. Others have favorably commented (are you doing something different? getting more sleep or exercise?) -so it's not just my impression.\n\nThe facial skin appears visibly improved with regular use of this face cream. No discoloration or other blemish have ever occurred while using this cream.\n\nL'Occitane Immortelle Divine Face Cream has been used nightly for a few months and it is well tolerated.  Its best use seems to be as an all-around moisturizing night cream (no sun block) that helps to even your tone and coloration. There has been no diminution of age-related skin 'dark spots'\n\nNo change in my original opinion after months of use. I still like it a lot.", "summary": "HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

The same happened to me\n-I'm still going to continue to apply it twice a day\nOn the first day of application, my eyes started feeling itchy n red. I looked like I had hay fever; a total reck. I realised it was bc i was kinda overapplying the product because more effective result. So I stopped applying it on my lower lashes to reduce the appearance of the redness around my eyes because I realli want this product to work. Don't want to give up  yet\n\nFor those who have or will the same reactions at the beginning, my advice is to not over apply the product.\nWat I mean is, before you apply it on ur lash line, make sure that ur brush isn't too soaked with the product or else when u apply it, ur going to have a more blotchy red appearance on ur eyes.\nSo basically just brush off some of the product on the rim of the tube, just like how u would do with nail polish.\nAnother tip is to apply it very close to the lash line/root of ur lashes so it will reduce the blotchy appearance etc\n\nBefore I bought this product I didn't realli expect my eyes to go red like some others complained. But my eyes r fine back to normal. It's only been a week\nThe redness and the itchiness was crazy for the 2-4days. But after that it will start to go away.\nJust reflecting... I'm very sure that this itchy reaction will happen to many other customers who might be interested in buying this product.\nBut wats more important is if my lashes grown,\nI'm still on my first or two weeks.\nI'm going to do an update on the growth of my eyelashes in the next couple of weeks\nPlease mind my grammar", "summary": ":).

Vitamin C is a great antioxidant and this particualr king of L-ascorbic acid comes in a 15% strength.  IT is important to mention that Obagi offer 4 different types of this serum.  They come in professional RX strength, 10%, 15% and 20% strength.  Packaging for the 15% strength is very specific in stating not to mix Professional Rx strength with 15% strength.  I use this serum in the morning and at night.  In the evening, when I have more time, I like to mix this serum with pure hyaluronic acid for additional moisture for the skin.  The other convenience of this product is that it comes with the enclosed pipette.  It helps control of how much product can be used on the skin.  I apply it on both face and neck and then I follow up with the moisturizer from the same line.  During daytime I also apply SPF to protect skin from damaging UV rays.  Great product.

I did feel a little difference in my texture, but nothing extreme enough to bother me or to tangle my hair.\n\nI wash my hair at night and fix it in the morning.  I figured the mousse would not affect anything about the styling, because it felt like it normally does in the morning.  I straighten my hair with a straightening brush (looks kind of like a paddle brush but is heated).  The COLOR WOW made it so that I could wear my hair flatter if I wanted or with more volume if I wanted to go that way.  I don't like a lot of volume, but it was easy to control.\n\nThe only negative I have about this mousse is that when I brushed my hair and was straightening it, I had white debris falling onto my shoulders.  It didn't seem to do it once I was done fixing my hair, though.  It could be my reaction to the ingredients, or it could be that I waited overnight to style my hair.", "summary": "Brightens blonde highlights", "unixReviewTime": 1461715200}

The combination of strong heat and entangled hair in the teeth of the brush caused me to lose large clumps of hair around the right side of my face.  It looks horrible.

My waves are stubborn as well...my hair stylist would agree!  What ended up working quite well for my hair was to take a small section and simply brush the styler once on the underside and once on the top side.  I twisted the brush to add some curl on the shorter front pieces and it worked like magic.  My hair is long and I'm not the best at styling it...adequate at best.  My hair almost looks like I just came from the salon!\n\nUpdate:  I have used the perfecter a couple more times and still LOVE it!  I think one of the best features is that I no longer have to worry about burning myself, especially when working with the hair at the back of my head.  The flat iron was always difficult to use back there, but now I can just \"brush\" without even looking.

When I do find a red with a blue tint, it's usually on the darker side. Finding a red that comes across as a true red - no orange, no blue, just red regardless of the skin tone its worn on - is rather difficult to do. This lip creme from Oribe is one of those rare true reds. When applied, this color is the classic red lipstick that needs nothing more than a simple cat eye makeup to look perfect. It applies very smoothly and easily, doesn't have a prominent scent, and doesn't have a funky taste. The color in the photographs for this listing are not representative at all of the color when it was applied to my lips. It looks like the color was photoshopped on to the lips of the models for the different skin tones for each of the three colors Oribe offers\n\nWhile the color is gorgeous, this isn't a lipstick I would really recommend, especially for this price. if you don't use a lip primer and lip liner, this lipstick will migrate and feather and come off on everything - anyone you kiss, your cup, your eating utensils, your teeth. If not applied to something to adhere it to lips and then set properly, it was shocking how fast it came off. If you have any trace of dryness on your lips, this color will exacerbate it. If you apply it with too much pressure, the bullet is so soft and creamy it is like smooshing frosting between your fingers. If you can, use a lip brush to apply this over prepped lips. The creaminess helps to keep your lips from getting dried out, and you can remove this lipstick with just a swipe of a tissue.\n\nEven though this lipstick is a such lovely color and perfect shade of red, I can't really recommend this for more than a special evening out or for photos. For anywhere from $5.00 to $30.00 less you can get lipsticks from Dior, Marc Jacobs, Urban Decay, BITE, Tarte, Besame, or others are as creamy and pigmented as this from Oribe but last all day. Even $6.00 lipsticks from Nyx (the Butter Lipstick or Gloss) gives pigment as good and stays longer than this one from Oribe. Finding this perfect red in lip friendly formula is great, but with the prep work needed to make it last for longer than a cup of coffee is a lot for a lippie that costs this much doesn't justify the cost with the options out there.", "summary": "Gorgeous but just doesn't last", "unixReviewTime": 1491696000}

My bottle expires in just 8 months, which means I basically have to use it up this Spring/Summer.\n\nAfter the best use date, it is my belief the sun block will still work, but the L-Ascorbic acid will have oxidized.\n\nI will add that the C-Serum definitely works, it does wonderful things for the skin. But this is not the cheap sunscreen you lather on. It comes in a small bottle, it's more like a cream, just apply a thin layer every few hours as needed.\n\nI'm also aware that the current trend is higher SPF (like 80 & 100), but I personally believe that SPF 30 is fine for most situations (unless you're in high altitude, on the water all day, or something like that). FYI, SPF-30 blocks 97% of UVB rays, and SPF-50 blocks 98%. So I don't think that's enough of a difference to worry about.\n\nFor anyone interested, you can mix up your own batch at home. There are two distinct advantages. First, the cost is only pennies per batch (as opposed to $50-$70 per bottle). The second is, you avoid the problem of short shelf life of C-Serum products. If you mix as you go, you don't have to worry about the bottle expiring. Here's how:\n\nYou can buy powdered L-Ascorbic Acid online (about $20 per kilogram), and simply mix with your favorite sunscreen. It goes bad after a couple days (when L-Ascorbic Acid turns yellow, it's oxidized and no longer works), so only make small batches at a time. Keep that in mind with your Obagi as well - if it comes out yellow or clumpy, the C-Serum has oxidized. You can also mix with your favorite night cream, or with vegetable glycerin for a normal daily serum.\n\nI love this product, my only complaint is the price. The short shelf life really can't be avoided, just be aware of this.", "summary": "Love the idea of adding C-Serum to suntan lotion. But it's pricey w/ a short shelf life.

One tiny vial container contains enough activator fluid for mere one application with the included pure marine algae Eye Masks. These eye masks are very fragile and tends to tear and break apart when you pour in the activator fluid. In the end the areas around the eyes does feel hydrated but nothing spectacular improvement that was noticeable with the suggested 10 mins.\n\nHaving said, The main reason for using the included pure marine algae Eye Masks is to apply the applicator fluid without using cotton based puffs which may contain pesticides that causes skin irritation but this also causes a lot of wastage of the applicator fluid since it drips and causing a messy waste since you are doing it at home alone and not in a professional SPA where someone else applies this for you while you lie down and sleep.\n\nWhat I have discovered is that the applicator fluid is good for the skin around your eyes. It does make skin softer and feels well moisturized. Does this remove the black circle marks around the eyes - Maybe but that means you need to keep spending a lot of money and wasting a lot of these applicator fluid & pure marine algae Eye Masks each time you use them.\n\nInstead I suggest that to make most use of this package and the six tiny vial containers by applying the applicator fluid directly around the skin of your eyes by your index finger just enough to moisten before you go to sleep every night and you will find positive improvement around your eyes. Not only because you are not wasting the applicator fluid but also long time application for 2-3 weeks every night does make the skin clear, tight and rejuvenated.\n\nFor the price & wastage of applicator fluid and messy difficult to use algae Eye Masks I am forced to rate this with two stars. Otherwise the product does not cause any harm to you other than raising eyebrows looking at the price-tag :)", "summary": "Expensive Juicey Solution!", "unixReviewTime": 1415664000}

The first thing I did was to just apply it to my freshly washed and moisturized face.  And looked like a corpse.  I couldn't imagine that was a \"look\" that most people are going for.  So I did a little research and found that typically finishing powder is applied on top of foundation.  So I washed and moisturized again, then applied some Bare Minerals foundation, which I haven't been loving as much lately because it seemed to give me a wrinkled paper look that wasn't flattering (or desired).  Since I'm an artist by trade, I decided to use the Japonesque as I would highlight a painting or drawing. Very nice.  But not WOW.  So, again with the washing and moisturizer.  This time I used some creamy foundation from Maybelline.  Then touched up the shiny spots with the Japonesque and WOW!!  My skin looked like a porcelain doll's, beautiful, even and lovely. Love it, love it, love it.\n\nIt comes in a cute but expensive looking case that stays shut in my bag or drawer. and includes an application sponge.  But I think it goes on better with a big, fluffy brush.  The texture of the powder is very silky and light and it makes my skin feel smooth like velvet, even with liquid foundation which tends to make even my dry skin look and feel a little greasy.  It also covers up spots very well and evens out the skin beautifully with a matte effect.  It looks really light in the package but it didn't change the shade of my makeup, it just made it all come together and look, well, finished.

I have been using this product for a little over a month & so far have experienced positive results.  I find one pump is more than enough product to lightly cover my entire face.  I apply eye cream first, then this serum, then my tinted moisturizer with SPF 15.  Normally I apply a bronzing powder & blush over the moisturizer because if I don't my face looks shiny.  Using this serum, even with over a week of highs in the upper 80's / lower 90's & working outdoors, my skin remains dry & smooth.  I have never experienced anything like it.  If this was the winter, I doubt I'd be able to use a serum such as this.\nIn the evening after washing my face I again apply my eye cream, then this serum & then pure organic argan oil.  In the morning my skin is not greasy, it is smooth & dry.  Once I went to bed & forgot to apply the argan oil.  My skin burned a little & felt very tight.  When I woke up the next morning I applied a little argan oil.  Aside from that I have nothing negative to report.\nI was very concerned that it would cause my skin to burn & turn red (called blushing in the instructions).  This has not happened, nor has my skin flaked.  I think my skin looks a little brighter & even toned, but considering the short amount of time I've been using this, I could just be seeing what I want to see (sorry but I tend to be pretty skeptical of products like this).\nI anticipate this bottle will last a long time.  I'm very curious to see what the end results are after long time use.  I will return to post any relevant updates should they arise.  Overall, I think this is worth trying if you can afford it, but I'm not too sure this is something you would want to use in the winter unless you have excessively oily skin.\nUPDATE 7-15-15 (was 5 stars at time of original review):\nThis lasted a little over 2 months.  I do not feel that the results are worth the price.  I think it improved very very minor marks but not the more noticeable marks.

This self tanner took the number one spot for a couple reasons. It lasts- this is one of the bigger issues I've experienced while using these types of products. This tanner specifically lasts for at least a week on me before I notice it really fading. This product looks better (deeper and more settled) on the 2nd and 3rd day following application. I would highly suggest using the St. Tropez tanning mitt with this product to avoid streaking. The mitt is super soft and is hand washable. One obvious negative is the price. However, you are paying for a high quality product that doesn't have a strong DHA smell. This smells delicious for the first few hours after applying. Even after the pleasant smell goes away, you aren't left with too strong of a DHA. I always recommend applying tanning products at night after you shower and exfoiliate. The color of this tanner is golden brown. There aren't any traces of orange or green; it is that perfect inbetween! It will lighten slightly after your first shower because the color guide will wash away. However, I notice a deepening of the tan after the first few days which I love! I will definitely be repurchasing this in the future!", "summary": "The Best Self Tanner (No Strong DHA Smell, Gold Brown Color)", "unixReviewTime": 1463788800}

For this reason, I have a routine I follow when shaving which includes a pre-shave ointment, using an older-style double edged safety razor, and post shave balm.  I've tried LOTS of products, both pre/post shave as well as shave creams.\n\nAs a pre-shave ointment, this product worked well but was not the best that I've used for a few reasons.  One of the main reasons is the requirement to apply it to a warm cloth and place on your face.  I prefer to take a warm shower and then apply a pre-shave ointment I can leave on my face for a few minutes while I do other things.  With that said, it performed fairly well in softening my facial hair.  I will likely continue to use Proraso Pre-Shave&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Proraso-Pre-Shave-Cream-Sensitive-Skin-3-6-oz-100-ml/dp/B003VS5O3Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Proraso Pre-Shave Cream, Sensitive Skin, 3.6 oz (100 ml)</a>.\n\nAs an after-shave, I did find it very refreshing.  I typically place a cool cloth on my face to combat irritation and adding this to the cloth was refreshing.  My face did feel better after using this versus only the cool towel.  With that said, again, it does take some time to go through this process.  If I'm in a hurry, I will continue to use my go-to post-shave balm.\n\nBottom Line: This is a nice product and works well; however, it requires some extra time and steps in your shaving cream.  I will continue to use it from time to time when able but it likely won't be a part of my daily shave routine.", "summary": "Good Product but Adds Time to Shaving Routine", "unixReviewTime": 1483920000}

She has beautiful, silky, pin-straight hair that won't hold a style for anything (but it sure is pretty). This made soft, silky, full curls in her hair that she just loved. I mean the results were  beautiful. (I used the steam setting with a slightly higher temp and time.) Next, I tried it on my younger daughter's (4 y/o) chin length very fine hair. I used a lower setting, and her hair came out in very beautiful loose curls and waves. They were both ecstatic with the results. I then tried it on my long naturally wavy (color-treated) hair. I was simply amazed. I have never gotten as good results from a salon visit. The curls were fully defined, soft, and shiny.

I have a full size container but it is pretty small (smaller than your average lip gloss).\n\nI'm mostly happy with it.  I chose this color because I thought it would be nice for a highlight color for the inner corners of my eyes, to brighten things up a bit.  It works for that quite well.  By the time I apply this, I already have on primer (I am using Urban Decay Primer Potion) and powder shadow.  I have not attempted to put this over my whole eyelid.  I have oily eyelids and powder products really work better for me over the whole lid.  But I don't like using standard shadow brushes for the inner corner of my eye, hence my selection of this.\n\nThis has a standard doefoot applicator of the type you see for liquid products of this consistency.  It does allow for fairly precise application to the desired spot.  After I dot a bit on, I blot/smudge it a little.  The texture at this stage is pretty good but not perfect.  I can't decide if I'd rather it have a bit more of a liquid consistency or something else.  There's just something slightly off in my mind.  It's certainly not bad enough to be a deal breaker (especially if I can't even articulate the issue well).  I can see it being a bigger problem over the whole eyelid, though.  (I can't say whether the texture issue would be the same across all colors since I've only tried the one.)  It is definitely possible to use only a small amount of this, if that's what you want (it was for me).\n\nThe color is nice.  I am the palest foundation shade and this shows up well both over darker shadow and on my bare skin.  I think it is opaque enough that it would look lovely on darker skin tones, as well.  It is not too sparkly and it is suitable for daytime wear (at least *I* think so), but there is a subtle shimmer.\n\nThis dries quickly and does not flake.  It is also not irritating; I have sensitive eyes and wear contact lenses, so this is an important feature for me.  Overall, I am basically happy with this -- it really does make a good inner corner highlighter for me, in terms of color and ease of application.", "summary": "\"champagne silk\" is good as an inner corner highlighter for the eye", "unixReviewTime": 1480896000}

To give you a little background about my hair. I had extremely HEALTHY, LONG, THICK blonde hair! It fell to the middle of my back, It was absolutely beautiful. I went to get it colored to give it a break from the highlights, I was going to change it to a strawberry blonde, which I have been many times before and other than blonde, its the only other color I like on me. When I went to the salon, they messed up the color. I ended up with hot pinkish, purple roots and a grayish auburn, mid-shaft to ends. I was in the salon that day for 7 and a half hours. They had to bleach my entire head and leave it on to get all of the screwed up colors out of my hair, resulting to EXTREME chemical damage and breakage. I went in with my hair being all one length to having bangs that were never even cut into my hair. My hair was destroyed and they had to take over 5inches off just to get the ends to LOOK healthy. My hair now sits on my shoulders and has broken pieces all over the top and mid section and all around my hair line. I have literally cried about this since it happened 5 weeks ago. It took me forever to get my hair exactly the way I wanted it and now I am starting over. My hair is no longer manageable, it is kinky and dry and looks it! The salon I had gone to was a new salon closer to where I moved. Prior to this salon I had been going to my original hairstylist for 15 years (I'm 30) so half of my life one person has touched my hair. I live two hours from her now so I decided to give a different salon a try and it was a mistake. I will now be driving 2 hours to go to her every 8 weeks. I texted her about 2 weeks after this all happened and she told me right away to order this product. I didn't hesitate. I ordered it and received it the beginning of this week. I have used it twice so far and I will tell you what, after the first time I noticed a difference! I am excited to see after a couple months and using this 3 times a week (Extremely damaged hair should use it more than once a week). I also have been sleeping with it on over night which I notice gives me better results. This is not a conditioning treatment, so it does need to be shampooed out.

I've tried laser hair removal twice already. The hair has definitely been reduced from what it was originally, but it isn't completely gone yet. So I wanted to find something that I could do at home where I can retouch the area myself as needed instead of spending thousands for additional rounds of treatment at a Skin Care facility.\n\nI found this product after a TON of research on the internet. It's very difficult to find at-home laser technology that works on brown skin. This product claimed to be the only one that can safely do it. I read many reviews and pondered the purchase for days before finally taking the leap and purchasing it. As the reviewers promised, it is definitely a painless process (there's a slight sting when you put it to the highest level) and it's very quick. However, I waited the full recommended time (7 weeks) and haven't seen any reduction in hair. Especially on my face, the hair is just as stubborn as it was before I started using this product. On my legs it seemed like it was working for a little bit, but after stopping I can see that the hair is coming right back.\n\nIf you want something that works, DON'T PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT. If they plan to advertise that it'll work on brown skin, they should make sure it does. I returned this product and am waiting for my refund.", "summary": "I waited the full recommended time (7 weeks) and haven't seen any reduction in ...", "unixReviewTime": 1463529600}

Haines", "reviewText": "I'm 41 and I've got reasonably decent skin as far as wrinkles go. I started wearing sunblock (good ones like Obagi or Skinceuticals) daily for the last 8 or 9 years. But I am incredibly fair and have a LOT of freckles. I've had IPL 3 times, which has significantly lightened the freckles and a large birthmark. So we're working from a different place here than if you've never had IPL and have lots of freckles. Skip to the end for info about dark spot correction.\n\nI've had the Tria laser for about a week and a half. As far as pain, it's like a baby IPL sting. IPL feels to me like a lighter close up to your skin with an accompanying rubber band snap. The Tria is not as uncomfortable. It hurts more on tenderer skin under the eyes than on the forehead. But it does burn. And the burning gets worse after you're done treating. It feels like a bad sunburn for a half hour or so and then maybe is mildly, and decreasingly tender over the next 24 hours. If you are sensitive to pain, this may be too much. If you're the kind of person that doesn't blink at 40% glycolic acid on your face, no worries. I've had some minor blotchy redness that lasts 12 hours or more but isn't particularly noticeable. It's the kind of thing I notice about myself and no one else sees.\n\nI haven't treated every day, letting my skin have a little time to heal up and flake off in between. I can't say yet that this will be a miracle cure for the 11 wrinkles between my eyes but I feel like it is doing something. I've had dysport once just between the eyes and it wore off about a month ago so I am hoping the Tria works for that. I'll follow up if I have more to say about a scar on my forehead, 11 wrinkles and the wrinkles it's actually supposed to treat. I think it will possibly help with that, but I feel it's too soon to say. But what I really bought this thing for is dark spots. Yeah, I know that's off label, but it works for that for sure.\n\nAs I said, I've had IPL. The first time, I had sooo many freckles and lots of them turned dark and flaked off. The next two times, really nothing happened as I think the setting was too low. Also, they did not get particularly close to my eyes where the goggles were and it left me with what I referred to as cheetah spots at the outside corners of my eyes. After a week and a half of 3 days on and 2 days off, those cheetah spots are fading away. Like IPL, the pigmented areas turn darker and then flake off in little flecks over the next few days. My experience has been that IPL mostly made my freckles much lighter, with a few disappearing and many still lightly visible. This seems to be doing the same thing.\n\nI'll try to update on results, assuming I continue to use it. The thing was the same sale price at Sephora as it is currently on here ($150) and so far, it pretty much achieved the results of one IPL treatment for the cost of essentially one IPL treatment so if it does anything else, bonus.", "summary": "Works for dark spots", "unixReviewTime": 1505692800}

LOL)\n3) .75 inch tapered barrel---for tousled waves\n4) 1.5 inch straight barrel---for loose waves\n\nAlready comes with a 1.25 inch clip barrel for polished curls.\n\nIntelligent digital technology.  An internal microchip controls temperature fluctuation ensuring even, optimal heat.  This is a nice feature.  Prevents burning of hair, I would hope.\nAlso note the following:\nCeramic barrels, 5 heat settings (WOW!), Auto world voltage and 1 hour auto shut-off\n\nWhen I pulled this item up on Amazon I saw that this review would be the first so I tried to give you a lot of information.\nMostly because this is a pricey curling iron when first viewed but I think that when you consider all of the issues that\nI have tried to share with you I think you can see what it is more expensive that a \"usual\" curling iron.\n\nThere is nothing \"usual\" about this nice product.\nHighly recommended", "summary": "Highly recommended---you'll probably leave this one to someone in your will  LOL", "unixReviewTime": 1443312000}

It is matte, but a touch shinier than I expected, which I actually like. It moisturizes nicely, which I expected from the ingredients. What surprised me was the amount of fragrance and plumping ingredients. The primary plumping ingredient is the Menthoxypropanediol. Its penetration is enhanced by the Tribehenin. It's the Menthoxypropanediol that gives the slightest menthol scent. I did experience some tingling from these and saw the slightest bit of lip plumping, but only when I applied the lipstick somewhat more thickly than usual. I also tested the lipstick by applying a ColourPop Ultra Matte to one side of my lips and this to the other side and definitely saw plumping.

I LOVE it, but figured this Clenziderm Lotion would perform similarly because it has 5% benzoyl peroxide. I have also used PanOxyl 10% Foaming Wash, as well as several other OTC benzoyl peroxide products (usually around 2.5%).\n\nAlthough it is effective at obliterating acne and keeping it at bay, this Clenziderm lotion feels very harsh to me. It has a sting after application that stays around for a good 15-20 minutes before going away. It also makes my skin red wherever I apply it (and it stays red for a while too). Now, as mentioned above, I am no stranger to benzoyl peroxides of this strength. I have also used many AHA/glycolics on my skin and have tolerated them very well. I am not someone with particularly sensitive or reactive skin. I have even used Panoxyl 10 as a face mask in the past, which was slightly irritating but it went away as soon as I washed it off (I don't know if it is \"recommended\" in the usage directions, so take that idea with a grain of salt ;)).\n\nAlthough I like Obagi Clenziderm Lotion enough to finish it, I don't believe I would purchase another tube because of the irritation--and more so because it doesn't dethrone La Roche-Posay Effaclar Duo.

In fact, maybe more than fine, as the aerosol cans never seem to hold as much as the pump versions, so perhaps it will last longer that way.\n\nI was a bit skeptical. Okay, more than a bit. The claims like oxygenation of your skin, the fact that it contains vitamin C, but you don't ingest it, all seems a bit hokey to me. However, I gave it a fair shot and sprayed it on my face (with my eyes closed, as they recommend), and it was nice. Refreshing, like my old plain water spray, but also has a nice light natural scent that reminds me of licorice and bananas. Nothing strong - this isn't perfume by any means. Just enough scent to be pleasant. I also found that my skin felt softer afterward. I'm really not sure why, but it was true.\n\nOverall, I like this. It is kind of like a little portable pick-me-up that would be great after coming inside from the heat, or just to break up a long day. I took off a star because it is crazy overpriced.

Friedman", "reviewText": "My daughter bought the Ahava Foam-Free Silk Shave Cream as a gift for me when she took a trip to Israel. I tried using it as an electric pre-shave for use with my rotary razor. I had recently bought myself a new, high-end shaver and was having some of the early-use, break-in period irritation you might expect when you start electric shaving or switch to another unit. (She also bought me the after-shave cream, which is really, really nice but very expensive if you're used to supermarket-priced guy stuff like me and don't go for salon/designer products.)\n\nI use the Ahava shave cream very sparingly, much more like a skin lotion in a very thin application than a full-blown, full-bodied shave cream or gel. Just that small amount on my damp beard allows the electric razor to glide over my face smoothly, without irritation. The cream (or lotion) is just rich enough to remain after the shave and give you a smooth feeling and leave you with a nice scent, even after shaving over it with the rotary (I don't wash with soap and water after the shave--that, I believe, would just undo the good of the lotion and perhaps even irritate my sensitive skin after the shave). I just give my skin a quick rinse with a little water, enjoy the smoothness, then gently dry.\n\nIt leaves me with a great shave, a good feeling, no irritation or burn, and even still a hint of the pleasant scent.\n\nSo, don't even think of using this as you would a normal shave cream. You'll use it up quickly (it's expensive!) and you'll feel like it wasn't worth it. Use it as an electric pre-shave lotion, sparingly, and it does a GREAT job! And it lasts quite a long time when applied in an amount about the size of a US nickel. Highly recommended if you can justify/afford the initial outlay.\n\nIf you're like I was most of my life and enjoy a blade shave, I can't attest to how well this would suit you.", "summary": "Excellent for electric pre-shave", "unixReviewTime": 1304380800}

The candle burns cleanly, though it does smoke rather badly when I first put it out. It comes in a beautiful glass container with a metal lid, which I keep on my candle in between burnings. The only real downside to this candle is that there is some citronella in it, which can smell a little like a cheap citronella candle when its been burned for a while.

I used 2 pumps on my fine, super straight hair that is below my chin in length but not quite to my shoulders. I seriously had to resist the urge to use more....it didn't seem like enough... but it was great. First I used the blow dryer to partially dry my hair then worked the two pumps of mousse throughout my damp hair. Then finished blow drying with a round brush. I roll sections in the brush, blow with hot air then set with cool air. I was REALLY impressed with the big curls I was able to achieve. Also my hair stayed smooth and didn't frizz which it tends to do. The frizzing is weird to me because my hair is so straight but some products seem to cause that -- this one smoothed it out. So even with \"big curls\" from the round brush my hair ends up straight but it felt full and bouncy all day AND it held the style. I also back-comb a bit and finish with Kenra hairspray.  Also my hair felt really soft. I suspect that the people who have had a bad experience with their hair feeling crunchy or sticky afterward may have used too much. I've had that happen in the past but I think it's partly because it's so tempting to feel like you need a lot of product. I have used TONS of volumizing products and this one is the first to truly impress me with the very first use!", "summary": "So glad I asked how to use this!", "unixReviewTime": 1461024000}

I washed my face using my standard oil cleansing and the awful feeling, redness and blotches cleared right up. I followed up with my other Kahina products (eye serum, cream, brightening serum, and lotion) and the itching/burning did not return. In the morning my skin was much clearer so I skipped this cleanser again and used my other Kahina products without a problem. If you have sensitive skin, at all, skip this product. It should also be noted that this does NOT adequately remove makeup. When I was finished thoroughly cleansing my skin with this product I had eye makeup leftover in raccoon fashion as well as a lot of foundation left over in my pores. If you're looking for a natural cleanser to get your makeup off at the end of the day this is NOT the one.", "summary": "OUCH!!", "unixReviewTime": 1384387200}

To be honest, I'm not as impressed with Glominerals Globlush as I am with their lip colors.  While there is nothing wrong with the Globlush, I just don't find it to be anything super special.  The blush color stays on just as long as other brand name mineral blushes and the color wasn't all that different from the blushes I already own despite the nomenclature.  Bare is a basic, neutral, flesh color with hints of pink but the pink isn't really noticeable on light-medium or darker skin tones.  I think the healthy \"flush\" I was looking for might only be visible on someone with an extremely fair complexion.\nI will confess that I purchased Bare without having the opportunity to see the color in person and relied solely on descriptions from Glominerals website and blogs, as well as customer comments.  In the end, this purchase wasn't a complete waste because I will eventually use up the blushes I already own and this will save me a trip to the department store makeup counter.  What I had hoped for, however, is something more fabulous than my existing stock, and something that would make me want to abandon all other makeup blush brands in favor of Glominerals.  I gave Globlush 4 stars because it is a solid makeup blush, something I will eventually use, and probably somewhat better quality than most drugstore brands.  Would I purchase Globlush again?  Unlikely.  Would I recommend Globlush to a friend? Not really.", "summary": "Nothing wrong with Globlush, but nothing special about Globlush either", "unixReviewTime": 1453420800}

My hair is highlighted and it usually feels more like straw but it felt so soft after using this spray. It also straightened beautifully and did seem shinier.\n\nI went out on a semi humid day after using this product and my hair stayed much straighter than it normally does. It was humid, so I sweated a bit around my scalp (I was out walking all day in NYC) and my hair on the crown of my head got pretty damp and that part got some wave to it. But I don't blame the spray because the humidity/sweating made my hair completely damp around the crown of my head. The rest of my hair stayed really straight.

The One Base 2.0 color is perfect for my medium fair, neutral toned skin. It is neither too pink, nor is it too yellow so it is what I think of as neutral toned. In the past, when I shopped concealers, they were either way too yellow or too pink for my skin. When I put One Base on, the color almost melts & easily blends right into my skin color which is important as I do not wear foundation. It isn't too oily or drying for my combination skin and doesn't crease on me. It does leave a bit of sheen so after it sets/drys, I brush on a very little skin toned face powder, just enough to knock down the sheen.

Second, this is strong enough that if you have sensitive skin it will burn a bit, hence me rinsing it. I could still feel the chemical exfoliation difference after I used it.

Graham", "reviewText": "Ok, so I'm not quite as skeptical or spirited as some of the reviewers.  I knew I was getting Relaxing Fragrant Water and I am ok with that.  The important thing is what makes the water relaxing and fragrant.  And does the relaxing fragrance delight the senses?  Before I ramble on, I did get this for my wife.  She tried and actually used it daily for a week before reviewing.\n\nThe scent is quite pleasing but it is not a light scent, nor is it overpowering.  My wife and stepdaughter both agreed it isn't bad.  None of us have a clue what \"plastic toy pony\" smells like (see other reviews) nor do we care to find out.  I do see that the product description is not very useful - there is no descriptive language about the scent.  My interpretation is a mix of coconut, subtle almond oil, musk, vanilla and some orange essence.\n\nThe company claims that the ingredients are 95% natural origin.  They are:  denatured alcohol, water, fragrance, limonene (i.e. lemon/orange oil), benzyl salicylate (i.e.a chemical used in cosmetics),  linalool (i.e. an alcohol chemical found in many flowers and spice plants), citronellal (i.e. citronella/rose/geranium), citral (found in lemon).  Sorry, no plastic toy pony.  Smelled directly, yeah, it is powerful.  Sprayed on in reasonable quantities, it is subtle and provides a good backdrop. I can't say there is any relaxation induced by this - we all found it somewhat energizing.\n\nNo side effects (rash, etc) were noted.\n\nWould any of the members of my family buy it again?  I suspect we would not go out of our way to purchase it again, mainly because no one in our house regularly buys fragrant water.  But the whole bottle will be used.  I'll go ahead and give it 5-stars because we all agree that it has a nice scent.\n\nOn to the review.", "summary": "Gentle mist, aromas work in harmony", "unixReviewTime": 1467072000}

I wanted to try it because since I am so fair skinned, I really don't want to be \"tan\" I just don't want to look sickly. Just want some healthy pigment. As you can see in my picture which I took in natural light, it is very light which is what I wanted.  Happy with the color and how dark it turned out on me (which is not dark at all) It applies very unevenly though. It's hard to apply, there isn't really a tan guard, it's just the color you're going to turn. For example I put it on before bed, wake up take a shower and none of the sparkle, or color comes off. I exfoliated, I shaved, I used the mit. Doesn't work like St. Tropez Express at all. I will definitely be going back to my favorite mousse soon.

This stuff was a real disappointment. First of all, let me preface by saying that went it comes to scented hair care, I've always turned to Philosophy products, so that is what I am used to. This product had no lather what so ever. I felt like I had to use 3x as much product as a regular shampooing just to work up the slightest bit of suds. And at $18 a bottle that is unacceptable. Two hours after the shampoo and the scent is still nice but my absolutely feels like fresh picked cotton. If that isn't a reference you can relate to,  well, it's rough, scratchy, like straw. I don't usually condition my hair, there's no need to, and is was especially diligent not to this morning because the whole point was to not wash out the scent. I am totally disappointed. I think this might make a good body wash with right nylon scrubby, but I won't be washing my hair with it again. For that I do recommend Philosophy!!", "summary": "Save your money!", "unixReviewTime": 1496880000}

There's the light / fresh aspects that make Rhythm interesting, but there's also the leathery pipe tobacco thing going. (If you've never smelled London, it's a lot like a spiced pipe tobacco.)\n\nRhythm Intense is a bit trickier to wear, though. It gets overpowering very easily, and takes a while to lighten up.
